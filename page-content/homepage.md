# Typical requests

### “We need a landing page, a pitch deck and a basic brand — in 5 days.”

We specialize in fast, high-impact branding for early-stage startups and projects. Within days, we help you launch a clean landing page, build a sharp pitch deck, and define your visual identity — logo, colors, typography, and tone of voice. Whether you’re preparing for investor conversations or a public beta, our pitch deck support and brand setup get you from zero to ready, fast.

### “We need expert consulting on our tech stack before we start hiring/building.”

Choosing the right tech stack is critical in the early stages of any startup project. We provide tech stack consulting tailored to your product vision, use case, and team structure. Whether you’re building a no-code MVP or scaling with custom APIs, we guide you in selecting the tools and infrastructure that save time and grow with you.

### “We want to build an AI copilot to support us / our clients in XYZ.”

We design and develop AI copilots that integrate into your internal tools or client-facing platforms. Using agentic workflows, LLM APIs, and automation tools, we help you create smart assistants tailored to your use case — from internal process support to external user engagement.

### “Can we automate this manual process?”

Absolutely. We identify automation opportunities within your current workflows and implement custom solutions using tools like Zapier, Make, or n8n. From email sequences to lead qualification to internal approvals — if it’s manual and repetitive, we can probably automate it.
