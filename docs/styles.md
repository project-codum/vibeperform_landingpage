## Brand Essence
- Core statement: `Vibeperform = intuitive human insight + measurable tech impact`; heroes should blend warmth with precision.
- Tone pillars: empathetic, confident, catalytic, data-backed; avoid hype or cold corporatese.
- Messaging rhythm: start with empathic observation, present insight, then show actionable outcome.

## Visual Identity
- Palette: deep navy `#0C1024` (trust), rich purple `#6C5CE7` (intuition), electric coral `#FF7A7C` (momentum accent), soft lavender `#F3F1FF` (background), graphite `#2E2F45` (neutral text).
- Gradients: use diagonal blends from lavender → purple or navy → coral for hero elements; keep shadows soft and diffuse.
- Typography: Display—`"Sora", sans-serif` (rounded geometric) for headlines; Body—`"Inter", sans-serif`; Monospace accent—`"JetBrains Mono"` for data callouts.

## Interface & Layout
- Grid: generous whitespace, 12-column layout with asymmetric hero split (story left, data viz right).
- Components: glassmorphism cards (8–12px blur) for insights, pill-shaped CTAs; use micro-lines/particles to suggest “signal flow.”
- Iconography: duotone outlined icons matching purple/navy; pair with subtle data glyphs (waveforms, nodes).
- Illustrations: abstract waveforms or signal pulses intertwining with human silhouettes to depict intuition + performance.

## Motion & Interaction
- Motion language: ease-in-out curves, 300–400ms; animate “pulse” radiating on hover; reveal stats with upward fades.
- Micro-interactions: highlight cards with gentle glow, CTA hover lifts 2–3px; navigation underline animates from center outward.

## Copy & Content
- Voice: conversational yet authoritative—“We tune your strategy” vs. “We provide services.”
- Structure: headlines focus on outcome (“Turn intuition into measurable momentum”), sublines clarify method.
- Proof points: pair qualitative story with quantitative metric (e.g., “Empathy map workshop” + “↑ 18% team NPS”).
- Calls to action: action verbs tied to rhythm—“Start the cadence,” “Sync with a strategist.”
